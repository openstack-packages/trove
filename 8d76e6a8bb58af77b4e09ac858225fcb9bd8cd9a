This patch is here because we didn\u0027t had a gitreview in place in the openstack-packages/trove repo. Still, it is something we need to define for the new version. Right now we place things on /etc/trove/conf.d/ and the truth is that we could place things directly on /etc/trove/, overwriting the default ones and making things clearer.",
